                <h2>Mojo have been making the majority of their product decisions based on
                    quantitive data. Tools like Google analytics, Power BI, Google optimise provided a wealth of raw
                    data, however, trends weren't being tracked, the data wasn't being pooled or reviewed. As a result
                    it becomes
                    increasingly hard to paint a clear picture of what success looks like for the product.
                    <br><br>
                    This also means that whilst Mojo knows a lot about 'how' someone uses their product, they know very
                    little of the 'why'. My task was to try and balance out Mojo's research debt by introducing more
                    qualitative user research methods such as; user
                    interviews, feedback channels, a way for users to self-serve common
                    questions and eventually, run remote usability tests.
                    <br><br>
                    The diagrams below were part of an audit of Mojo's current research landscape. The outcome of which
                    was
                    identifying that there are clear gaps, a 'monoculture' of research had begun to emerge.

                <h2>Ask ten people what on-boarding means and you'll get ten different answers. At Mojo, we defined it
                    as beginning when
                    the user lands on the homepage, to booking an appointment with one of our advisors. To improve our
                    on-boarding experience we began
                    with a 2 day service mapping session. I ran these sessions along with another designer, in them we
                    invited collegues from different areas of the business (ops, dev, product, cx), walked them through
                    the journey we mapped out, asked them if they agreed with how we had mapped it and if they had any
                    amendments.
                    We then asked them to pinpoint any pain-points. By asking a good cross-section of experts, we made
                    sure we had a variety of view-points.
                    <br><br>
                    Next we reframed these paint points into general, high-level 'How Might We's. From there each HMW
                    becomes a kick-off for a separate white-board session with 2 or 3 product team collegues. Within
                    these sessions we'll agree on a loose idea, discuss contraints and timings.
                    <br><br>
                    Typically this sort of exercise would be combined with field research, speaking to real users,
                    collecting weeks/months of quantative research to help back up any assumptions we may have made
                    during the mapping workshops.

                <h2>Many of the pain points that came out of our initial mapping sessions were related to the amount of
                    questions we ask a user up-front, and how little context we provide for asking them. From key
                    stakeholder interviews, we identified that users were frequently entering the wrong information,
                    skipping sections or dropping out of the journey altogether. This combined with a
                    user feedback via Intercom, Cx enquires and from watching usability videos on
                    FullStory - it was easy to start to identify key pain points.
                    <br><br>
                    As a result of our mapping and HMW exercises, we would provide more context via inline tooltips and
                    perfrom a question protocol to eliminate unneccessary questions. Tooltips should always be displayed
                    inline, if the information is important to the user it should never be hidden. I created rules and
                    patterns for 4 different types of tooltips.
