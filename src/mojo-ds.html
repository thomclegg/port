                <h2>Mojo have been making the majority of their product decisions based on
                    quantitive data. Tools like Google analytics, Power BI, Google optimise provided a wealth of raw
                    data, however, trends weren't being tracked, the data wasn't being pooled or reviewed. As a result
                    it becomes
                    increasingly hard to paint a clear picture of what success looks like for the product.
                    <br><br>
                    This also means that whilst Mojo knows a lot about 'how' someone uses their product, they know very
                    little of the 'why'. My task was to try and balance out Mojo's research debt by introducing more
                    qualitative user research methods such as; user
                    interviews, feedback channels, a way for users to self-serve common
                    questions and eventually, run remote usability tests.
                    <br><br>
                    The diagrams below were part of an audit of Mojo's current research landscape. The outcome of which
                    was
                    identifying that there are clear gaps, a 'monoculture' of research had begun to emerge.
