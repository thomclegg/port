                <h2>Within the Push Doctor office we built a user testing area which we called 'The Pod'. Here we could
                    invite a variety of users to workshops, usability sessions or simply just to pick their brains on a
                    certain topic.
                    Our users fall into two categories; Patient and Doctor.
                    <br><br>
                    As a patient, I need to be able to connect to a doctor easily,
                    without technical disruption or unnecessary user error.
                    <br><br>
                    As a doctor, I need to be able to connect to my patient quickly, be able to clearly see/hear them
                    and be confident that they have completed all of the necessary verification checks beforehand.
                    <br><br>
                    We ran regular workshops and usability tests with these user groups, as well as performed site
                    visits to
                    see how doctors use our software day-to-day. These sessions gave us some amazing insights. I used
                    the 'jobs to be done' framework
                    to turn these insights into user needs, which helped me move forward and ask the right questions.

            <h1>Disruptions</h1>
            <div class="research-link">
                <h2>Towards the end of 2018, our customer service team reported a high number of complaints from users
                    stating that their consultations were ending prematurely. Likewise, we were getting multiple
                    complaints from doctors that they were forced to end consultations early due to a variety of
                    reasons.
                    <br><br>
                    Our first steps were to capture what exactly these reasons were from a doctors point of view, as
                    they were the only user who could 'disrupt' a consultation rather than simply 'leave' or end the
                    call. Next we built a simple questionnaire which, when a doctor disrupts a consultation, asks them
                    to categorise the reason why.
                    <br><br>
                    Collecting this data was absolutely key in helping shape and define what our potential solution/s
                    would be. By arranging the disrupt reasons by frequency we identified the top reasons for disrupted
                    consultations were:
                    <br><br>
                    1. Technical error; Either the patient or doctors' video or audio failed and as such neither side
                    could see or hear
                    each other.
                    <br><br>
                    2. The patient didn't have the correct form of I.D.
                    <br><br>
                    3. The patient misunderstood the type of care they could receive on our platform.
                    <br><br>
                    This led us to create several hypothesis which would help kick-off some simple white-board wireframe
                    sessions
                    with a team made up of myself (design), front-end, product owner and user researcher. We turned
                    these hypothesises into
                    How Might We's such as; How might we ensure the user has all the relevant information about accepted
                    forms of I.D before entering a consultation? And,
                    How might we improve our technical checks and only let users who have passed the requirements start
                    a consultation?
                    <br><br>
                    How might we's are a great way to provide a top level framework of an idea, which can then be
                    moulded into a solution by the team.

            <div class="research-link">
                <h2>To reduce disruptions we came up with three solutions as a v1;
                    <br><br>
                    1. We would improve both the back-end processing of tech-checks to mitigate the user simply
                    clicking through our current tech-checks without actually passing them, and our UI to make the whole
                    process smoother and more intuitive for the user.
                    <br><br>
                    2. Sign-post what forms of I.D the user will need based on the type of appointment they require. For
                    example, a
                    patient needs additional I.D if they booked the consultation on behalf of a child.
                    <br><br>
                    3. Improve our proposition work on the website

                    'Don't allow' and shutting us out of their device. Use of the camera and microphone is obviously a
                    key part of using our service! Our hypothesis was that if we successfully manage to 'prime' the user
                    that we need access to their device hardware, the user will be more likely to allow it in the first
                    instance and hopefully avoid having to leave the app, go into their settings and manually turn the
                    permissions back on.

                    1. We would implement back-end systems which would monitor a patients camera, microphone and
                    speakers for activity, allowing us to check their device and remove the ability to enter into a
                    consultation with no video, audio or a poor connection speed.
                    <br><br>
                    2. Re-design our current tech check experience and improve the UI to give more context to the user
                    around why these steps were important.

                    their account, we created a solution which alerts the patient about what ID they need, and what to
                    do if they don't currently have the required ID with them.
